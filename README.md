TITLE: Yoga4All
AUTHOR: Priyanka Rajeev Hichkad

Yoga4All is a **Ubiquitous Computing project** under the guidance of **Prof. Hari Prabhat Gupta, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT BHU**.  
The project leverages **wearable motion sensors** to recognize yoga poses, focusing initially on *Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutation)*, and aims to provide feedback on correctness and performance analysis.  

---

## Project Overview  
Yoga4All is designed to make yoga practice smarter and more accessible by utilizing **time-series sensor data** rather than vision-based methods. Sensor readings are collected using **MPU-9250 IMU sensors**, which provide **accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data** stored in CSV format.  

The project objectives are:  
- Detect and classify yoga poses using **machine learning and deep learning sequence models** (LSTM, GRU, and related architectures).  
- Construct a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** where nodes represent poses and edges represent transition times.  
- Develop **feedback mechanisms** for evaluating execution speed, angular deviation, and overall correctness.  
- Expand the system beyond Surya Namaskar to accommodate broader yoga practices in future work.

## Current Progress  

**Week 1:**  
- Understood the project scope and divided responsibilities among groups.  
- Reviewed the research paper *YogaHelp: Leveraging Motion Sensors for Learning Correct Execution of Yoga with Feedback*.  
- Explored the three types of motion sensors being used; two procured, one designed by our senior.  
- Understood that the sensors record data in **CSV format** containing accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer readings.  
- Learned about the projectâ€™s **REST API** (Swagger), which enables data upload and access from remote systems.  

**Week 2:**  
- Initiated **data collection** by performing Surya Namaskar with wrist-mounted sensors, with parallel video recordings for validation.  
- Explored deep learning approaches, particularly **LSTM and GRU**, as suitable models for time-series data.  
- Studied a **Human Activity Recognition (HAR) model** from Kaggle to identify strategies applicable to our dataset.  

**Week 3:**  
- Continued structured data collection (approximately 10 sets weekly, 1 set = 2 Surya Namaskar rounds).  
- Processed data by aligning sensor readings with video-recorded timings, removing unnecessary or noisy segments.  
- Conducted additional data collection at the **Student Activity Centre (SAC)** to capture Surya Namaskar performed with proper form.

## Next Steps  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Develop robust scripts for cleaning, segmentation, and normalization of sensor signals.  
- **Data Labeling:** Finalize an approach to label each data segment with its corresponding yoga pose to enable supervised learning.  
- **Model Development:** Train and compare multiple deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, hybrid architectures) for pose recognition.  
- **Graph Construction:** Build a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to represent poses and their transitions, with weighted edges.  
- **Feedback System:** Implement mechanisms to evaluate correctness based on execution speed and angular deviation.  
- **Evaluation:** Benchmark against baseline HAR frameworks to validate accuracy and robustness.

## Future Plans  
- Extend recognition beyond Surya Namaskar to include **other yoga asanas** and more complex yoga sequences.  
- Incorporate **multi-sensor setups** (wrist, ankles, waist) to improve recognition accuracy.  
- Integrate the system into a **mobile or wearable application** for real-time feedback.  
- Investigate **transfer learning approaches** using publicly available HAR datasets to improve generalization.  
- Enhance the **feedback module** to provide detailed corrective guidance rather than only correctness scores.
